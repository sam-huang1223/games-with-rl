# Reinforcement Learning for Blackjack

### Motivation
Yes, yes I know it's a "solved" game that is proven to always favor the house unless you count cards (Ã  la 21).

I just want to understand and practice implementing RL algorithms, while also having a bit of fun experimenting with my favorite casino game.

### Goals
1. Practice implementing basic RL algorithms
2. Practice incorporating Python programming best practices
3. Test Hypothesis that all algorithms eventually converage to Blackjack "Basic Strategy"
4. Profit???
